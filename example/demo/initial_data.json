            "body": "Editor's Note: Brendan Eich, Mozilla CTO, posted on [his blog](http://brendaneich.com/2012/02/mobile-web-api-evolution/) about Mozilla and the mobile Web API evolution. This is reposted below:\r\n\r\nRagavan Srinivasan's [post about the forthcoming Mozilla Marketplace](http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2012/02/22/mozilla-marketplace-opening-for-app-submissions-soon/) for [Open Web Apps](https://apps.mozillalabs.com/) inspired me to write about Mozilla's surging Web and Device API standards work.\r\n\r\n<inline type=\"inline_media.picture\" id=\"4\" class=\"inline_medium_right\" />A bit of background. Mozilla has always contributed to web standards, going back to the start of the project. We [co-founded](http://brendaneich.com/2004/06/the-non-world-non-wide-non-web/) the [WHAT-WG](http://www.whatwg.org/) to kick off [HTML5](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html). As readers of this blog know, we are a leader in [JS standardization](http://ecmascript.org/). We have some of the top [CSS](http://dbaron.org/) and [layout](http://robert.ocallahan.org/) experts in the world.\r\n\r\nIn the last eight months, our efforts to extend the web standards to include new APIs needed to build compelling apps and OS components on mobile devices have really caught fire. [B2G](http://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G) and [Open Web Apps](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Apps/Roadmap) are the fuel for this fire.\r\n\r\nSo I thought I would compile a list of emerging APIs to which we've contributed. In citing Mozillans I do not mean to minimize the efforts of standardization colleagues at Google, Microsoft, Nokia, Opera, the W3C and elsewhere. Standards are a multi-vendor effort (although excluding WebGL [see UPDATE below] one shiny name is conspicuously absent from this list).\r\n\r\nThe Mozilla contributions are worth noting both to acknowledge the individuals involved, and to highlight how Mozilla is championing device APIs for the web without having a native application stack blessed with such APIs on offer. We see the Web as quickly evolving to match native stacks. We have no other agenda than improving the Web to improve its users' lives, including Web developers' lives -especially mobile users and developers.\r\n\r\nAs always, standards in progress are subject to change, yet require prototype implementation and user-testing. Mozilla remains committed to playing fairly by not forging de-facto standards out of prototypes, rather proposing before disposing and in the end tracking whatever is standardized.\r\n\r\nHere is the list, starting with some 2011-era work:\r\n\r\n* [Geolocation](http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html), with Google contributing the editor and Firefox (thanks to [Jay Sullivan](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/press/bios/#bio-sullivan) leading the charge) implementing early.\r\n* [WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/1.0/) (UPDATE: Chris Marrin of Apple edited) and [typed arrays](http://www.khronos.org/registry/typedarray/specs/latest/).\r\n* [Gamepad API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/gamepad/raw-file/default/gamepad.html). Co-editor: Ted Mielczarek. Mozillans are also contributing to [Pointer Lock](http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/pointerlock/raw-file/default/index.html).\r\n* [Screen Orientation](http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/screen-orientation/raw-file/tip/Overview.html). Editor: Mounir Lamouri.\r\n* [navigator.getUserMedia](http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/getusermedia.html). Co-editor: Anant Narayanan\r\n* [Battery Status](http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-battery-status-20111129/) (in Last Call). From the Acknowledgements:\r\n > Big thanks to the Mozilla WebAPI team for their invaluable feedback based on prototype implementations.\r\n* [Media Capture](http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html-media-capture-20110414/). Fabrice Desr\u00e9 prototype-implemented in Gecko.\r\n* [Network API](http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/netinfo/). Editor: Mounir Lamouri.\r\n* [Web Telephony](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/WebTelephony). Ben Turner, Jonas Sicking, Philipp von Weitershausen.\r\n* [Web SMS](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/WebSMS). Mounir Lamouri, Jonas Sicking.\r\n* [Vibration](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-vibration-20120202/). From the Acknowledgements:\r\n > The group is deeply indebted to Mounir Lamouri, Jonas Sicking, and the Mozilla WebAPI team in general for providing the WebVibrator prototype as an initial input.\r\n* [File API](http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/).

As readers of this blog know, we are a leader in <a href=\"http://ecmascript.org/\">JS standardization</a>. We have some of the top <a href=\"http://dbaron.org/\">CSS</a> and <a href=\"http://robert.ocallahan.org/\">layout</a> experts in the world.</p>\n<p>In the last eight months, our efforts to extend the web standards to include new APIs needed to build compelling apps and OS components on mobile devices have really caught fire. <a href=\"http://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G\">B2G</a> and <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Apps/Roadmap\">Open Web Apps</a> are the fuel for this fire.</p>\n<p>So I thought I would compile a list of emerging APIs to which we've contributed. In citing Mozillans I do not mean to minimize the efforts of standardization colleagues at Google, Microsoft, Nokia, Opera, the W3C and elsewhere. Standards are a multi-vendor effort (although excluding WebGL [see UPDATE below] one shiny name is conspicuously absent from this list).</p>\n<p>The Mozilla contributions are worth noting both to acknowledge the individuals involved, and to highlight how Mozilla is championing device APIs for the web without having a native application stack blessed with such APIs on offer. We see the Web as quickly evolving to match native stacks. We have no other agenda than improving the Web to improve its users' lives, including Web developers' lives -especially mobile users and developers.</p>\n<p>As always, standards in progress are subject to change, yet require prototype implementation and user-testing. Mozilla remains committed to playing fairly by not forging de-facto standards out of prototypes, rather proposing before disposing and in the end tracking whatever is standardized.</p>\n<p>Here is the list, starting with some 2011-era work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html\">Geolocation</a>, with Google contributing the editor and Firefox (thanks to <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/press/bios/#bio-sullivan\">Jay Sullivan</a> leading the charge) implementing early.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/1.0/\">WebGL</a> (UPDATE: Chris Marrin of Apple edited) and <a href=\"http://www.khronos.org/registry/typedarray/specs/latest/\">typed arrays</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/gamepad/raw-file/default/gamepad.html\">Gamepad API</a>.

I concede that these ideas scare the shit out of people. In fact, when I first heard Jens Meiert propose the idea in 2009 my brain rejected it.\r\n\r\n<inline type=\"inline_media.picture\" id=\"1\" class=\"inline_full_centered\" /> Still, I think many of the markup parsing curiosities that can be frightening only need to be understood by HTML minifiers. Always leave it up to tools to make your frontend payload smaller; you just want the most comfortable and maintainable authoring environment possible.\r\n\r\nI shared them in this talk because 1) it can lead to writing more beautiful HTML that is easier to maintain. Leaving off </li>'s is a good example. 2) I just want people to consider browsers less of a black box of uncertainty. There are rules and specs that define behavior, so once understood you can feel confident relying on a consistent behavior. We certainly don't have that consistency across all the web platform, but for these examples you do.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I'm not advocating you write more spartan markup if you don't want to. But if it makes you feel good, by all means, go at it; you know now how the browsers work.\r\n\r\nOriginal post: <a href=\"http://paulirish.com/2011/primitives-html5-video/\">http://paulirish.com/2011/primitives-html5-video/</a>",

Always leave it up to tools to make your frontend payload smaller; you just want the most comfortable and maintainable authoring environment possible.</p>\n<p>I shared them in this talk because 1) it can lead to writing more beautiful HTML that is easier to maintain. Leaving off </li>'s is a good example. 2) I just want people to consider browsers less of a black box of uncertainty. There are rules and specs that define behavior, so once understood you can feel confident relying on a consistent behavior.
